# Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for getting a project up and running.
Built on Gulp, made for use with Sass.

`NOTE`: must have gulp installed globally

`Clone` the repository and run the following commands

`npm install`

`npm start` | `gulp serve` This runs watch commands on your html files, compiles sass using postcss and autoprefixer.

`Port 4000`: The port this is served running localhost.

`BUG NOTE`: Browser-sync stream is not working so sass is compiled and a hard reload at the moment.
